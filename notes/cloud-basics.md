## Cloud 101 ☁️

### Cloud basics:
- CapEx - Money spent to buy HW for your datacenter.
- OpEx - Money spent to manage/maintain that HW.
### What does Cloud provide?
- HA - app is deployed in multiple AZs to make it highly available.
- FT - if an AZ goes down, apps remain up due to FT.
- Elasticity  --- dynamic, can grow or shrink.
- Scalability  --- can just grow.
- Agility.
- Disaster recovery - if a region is down, services are still up.
- Global reach.
- Security.
## Economies of scale:
- Cloud providers get discounts from various vendors. Cloud providers then pass on those discounts to customers so you can run your infra/apps for cheap. 
### Cloud models:
- Public cloud - Azure, Google, AWS.
- Private cloud - on-prem, full control, full responsibility.
- Hybrid cloud - connect private with public. ½ on-prem, ½ cloud or similar.
